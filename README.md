Our project focuses on developing a predictive model for the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children. By aggregating data from various sources including medical records, developmental assessments, and parental reports, we identify key features indicative of ASD such as social communication skills, repetitive behaviors, developmental milestones, and sensory sensitivities. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, we train the model to differentiate between children with ASD and typically developing children based on these features. Through rigorous validation processes, including cross-validation techniques and clinical testing, we ensure the model's accuracy and reliability in real-world settings. Once validated, the model will be integrated into clinical practice, offering healthcare professionals a valuable tool for early diagnosis and intervention, ultimately improving outcomes for children with ASD and their families.
